For example: "Your account are suspended" or "Click here to reactive." Legitimate organizations usually proofread their messages. Furthermore, beware of vague, sweeping questions - it may be an attempt to get people to open up.',

While receiving malicious traffic directly from these domains is uncommon, its not impossible. If youre not in regular contact with organizations or individuals in those regions, treat such emails with extra scrutiny. The company network is mentioned early in the message‚Äîmake sure all email addresses match who they claim to be, and verify any unexpected attachments or requests before engaging.',

If you are especially concerned, report the email to IT or simply delete it. Be especially vigilant with compressed ".zip" files if you do not usually recieve them and look out for executable file types like ".exe", ".bat", or ".dll" that may be hidden inside some scam emails.',

Be on the lookout for this if you are using a service you are not used to. If you are uncertain you can always just search for the main domain instead.',

Be aware of what is contained within the emails you recieve, and if you recieve a message from someone you arent expecting consider using a 3rd party service or contacting them directly to confirm the authenticity of the email.',
                            'Typosquatting' => '"Typosquatting" or "Domain Spoofing" is the practice of registering domains with very similiar names to legitimate ones in the hope a user may mistype the fake address into their search bar, or that they dont notice the error in a link they click on. for example "mircosoft.com" or "HBSC.com" look very similiar to real domains but both have typos in them.'
